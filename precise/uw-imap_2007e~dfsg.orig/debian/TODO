  * Support non-self-signed certificates, and ask for optional CA
    certificate or already prepared (or bought) certificate and private
    key.
  * Add hint to certificates about the creator, and check for creator in
    postrm and remove if matching.
  * Suggest the above to slapd, dovecot and others creating self-signed
    certificates (or maybe create a dh_cert helper package?).
  * Shlibs patch links unconditionally against -lk5crypto - should
    probably do a check similar to the one in Makefile.gss.
  * Now that $C/ARCHIVENAME is correctly read in src/imapd/Makefile and
    src/ipopd/Makefile, check if other parts of 01_shlib.diff is no
    longer needed.
  * Add note in README.Debian of other packages that more documentation
    is in libc-clientXXX.
  * Improve backport-compatibility based on Bug#224237
  * Check and eliminate all FIXMEs and TODOs within scripts.
  * Replace 01_shlibs.patch with use of SPECIALS and (for static lib)
    EXTRASPECIALS
