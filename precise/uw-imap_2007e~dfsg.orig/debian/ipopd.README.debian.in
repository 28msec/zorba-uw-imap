UW IMAP IPOPD __VER__ FOR DEBIAN
================================

[Note: ipopd uses the c-client library for most of the actual work of
handling mail.  So you should read the documentation in
/usr/share/doc/libc-client__VER__/ too.]


SSL support
===========

This package has been compiled with SSL support.  On installation it will
generate a self-signed certificate for you in /etc/ssl/certs/ipop3d.pem.
(POP2 over SSL is not supported.) It will expire in one year.  You can
replace this with a certificate from verisign etc. if you want. Or you can
follow the instructions in the openssl package to generate your own.


Authentication
==============

This package uses PAM for authentication.  The configuration file is 
/etc/pam.d/pop

It has also been compiled with CRAM-MD5 SASL and APOP support.  
See /usr/share/doc/libc-client__VER__/md5.txt for additional information.
NOTE:  If your users seem to have problems logging in, this is the first
thing to check.

It also has Kerberos support via GSSAPI.  Here's how to enable it.

  * Create pop3/hostname@REALM keytab using kadmin.local
  * add the resulting key to /etc/krb5.conf on the pop server
  * Make sure that libsasl-gssapi-mit is installed on the clients
  * get Kerberos tickets

(thanks Sam Hartman)


POP2 and encryption
===================

As mentioned in /usr/share/doc/libc-client__VER__/README.Debian, c-client now
disallows plaintext logins by default.  However POP2 has no provision for
SSL/TLS encryption so if you need POP2 (in addition to POP3), you have to
enable plaintext logins.
