uw-imap (8:2007b~dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Maildir support dropped!  Patch earlier applied was not freely
    licensed and its author has explicitly requested its removal.
    No alternative reliable Maildir patch is known to exist currently.

uw-imap (7:2004g.debian1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Maildir is back! According to documentation this should be a more
    flexible and well supported implementation. Let's see if it is true!
    Beware, however, that it is still an unofficial patch - it is not
    supported upstream. Bugfixes are welcome, but problems reported
    without fixes will only lead to the Maildir support being dropped
    again.
    In other words: Maildir is EXPERIMENTAL - use at your own risk!

uw-imap (7:2002ddebian1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop Maildir patch. The code has always been buggy, is unsupported
    upstream and hasn't been maintained for several years. In addition,
    it may be the cause of security issues.
    The code and texts related to Maildir is kept in the source package
    for those interested in recompiling locally, but is no longer
    officially supported by Debian.

  * New upstream version.  SSL/TLS functionality is now built in so the
    old -ssl packages are obsolete.
  * WARNING: plaintext logins have been disabled for non SSL/TLS
    connections.  See /usr/share/doc/libc-client__VER__/README.Debian for
    further information. (Closes: #164454)
