UW IMAP IPMAPD __VER__ FOR DEBIAN
=================================

[Note: imap uses the c-client library for most of the actual work of
handling mail.  So you should read the documentation in
/usr/share/doc/libc-client__VER__/ too.]


SSL/TLS support
===============

This package has been compiled with SSL support.  On installation it will
generate a self-signed certificate for you in /etc/ssl/certs/imapd.pem.  
This certificate will expire in one year. You can replace this with a
cerificate from verisign etc. if you want.  Or you can follow the instructions 
in the openssl package to generate your own.


Authentication
==============

This package uses PAM for authentication.  The configuration file is 
/etc/pam.d/imap

It has also been compiled with CRAM-MD5 SASL support.
See /usr/share/doc/libc-client__VER__/md5.txt for additional information.
NOTE:  If your users seem to have problems logging in, this is the first
thing to check.

It also has Kerberos support via GSSAPI.  Here's how to enable it.

  * Create imap/hostname@REALM keytab using kadmin.local
  * add the resulting key to /etc/krb5.conf on the imap server
  * Make sure that libsasl-gssapi-mit is installed on the clients
  * get Kerberos tickets
