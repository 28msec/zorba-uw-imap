UW IMAP C-CLIENT FOR DEBIAN, DEVELOPERS NOTES
=============================================


GNU C++ (G++)
=============

In the C-Client code is defined "and", "or" and "not", which clashes
with reserved words in c++.

Until recently this was solved in Debian by patching the source to use
other names, but upstream now recommends using the g++ compile option
"-fno-operator-names" instead. I must admit that I do not understand the
issues involved - please get in touch with me if the former patch is
still needed.
