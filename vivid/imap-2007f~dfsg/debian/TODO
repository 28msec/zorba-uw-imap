  * Shlibs patch links unconditionally against -lk5crypto - should
    probably do a check similar to the one in Makefile.gss.
  * Now that $C/ARCHIVENAME is correctly read in src/imapd/Makefile and
    src/ipopd/Makefile, check if other parts of 01_shlib.diff is no
    longer needed.
  * Check and eliminate all FIXMEs and TODOs within scripts.
  * Replace 01_shlibs.patch with use of SPECIALS and (for static lib)
    EXTRASPECIALS
