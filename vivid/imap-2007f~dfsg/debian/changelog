  * Unfuzz patches.
  * Update semi-auto-update warning in debian/rules to advertise
    DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL.
  * Update cdbs dependency cleanup to strip cdbs 0.4.27 (not 0.4.27-1).
  * Release for experimental as instructed by Release team at the end of
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/06/msg00000.html
  * Add new file README.source (only draft for now - need more work to
    comply with Debian Policy 3.8).
  * Rewrite debian/copyright:
    + Use recent draft of machine-readable format proposed at
      http://wiki.debian.org/Proposals/CopyrightFormat
    + Refer to Apache 2.0 license at common location, thanks to lintian
    + License debian packaging as GPL-2+
    + Move details on repackaging and Maildir patch to README.source.
  * Strip Macintosh binary from source (in addition to RFC documents).
    Document stripped files in README.source.
  * Rely on debhelper to install lintian overrides (without tightening
    build-dependency: overrides are just gracefully ignored if too old
    debhelper is used), thanks to lintian.
  * Drop deprecated linda overrides, thanks to lintian.
  * Fix referring to /usr/share/doc (not /usr/doc) in a README, thanks
    to lintian.
  * Update local cdbs snippets:
    + Major improvements to copyright-check, most importantly avoiding a
      FTBFS by only warning about changes to copyright-hints by default.
      Update debian/copyright_hints.
    + Various improvements to upstream-tarball.mk, including renaming
      top srcdir in repackaged tarball to $pkg-$ver.orig to comply with
      Developers Reference 6.7.8.2.  Simplify use in debian/rules.
    + Update debian/README.cdbs-tweaks.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility to level 6 (was 4).
  * Semi-auto-update debian/control to apply above cdbs-related changes:
    DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL=yes fakeroot debian/rules clean
    This also bumps names of binary library packages (historic artifact
    to cope with restrictive license that has since been improved, but
    too much in the packaging routines is tied to that naming scheme to
    change this close to release of Lenny), and updates README.Debian
    (and more) which closes: bug#461386, thanks to Tomas Pospisek.
  * Set urgency=medium as this should hopefully reach Lenny, due to new
    release containing only bugfixes, and the cdbs fixes to avoid FTBFS.

  * Separate part of patch 01_shlib about MAILSPOOL into new patch
    02_mailspool.
  * Unfuzz remaining 2 patches and compact them (speeds patching a bit).
  * Enable IPv6 support. Closes: bug#299818.
  * Improve logcheck rules. Closes: Bug#244324 (thanks to Paul Traina).
  * Improve Debian version handling:
    + Change version number scheme to ${upstream}.debian${debianver}
      (separate upstream and "debian" with a dot) to properly handle
      alphanumerics in upstream version ( 2004debian1 !> 2004ddebian ).
    + Parse more cleverly: Reuse simply expanded variables.
    + Handle UPSTREAMVER and use it to automatically update watch file.
  * Several updates to debian/TODO.Debian.
  * Patch _after_ checking for up-to-date debian/rules, not before.
  * Update cdbs snippets related to po-debconf. Closes: bug#332136
    (thanks to Joey Hess).
  * Add new local cdbs snippet copyright-check.
  * Update remaining cdbs files, and add debian/README.cdbs-tweaks
    documenting their purpose.
  * Add myself as author of debian/rules (nothing is left from debmake).
  * Raise priority again for libc-client-dev from extra to optional, to
    match current overrides.
  * Add new promising Maildir patch. Closes: bug#273678, #230343,
    #312401 (thanks to Tomas Pospisek).
  * Now that Maildir support is added back the high priority debconf
    warning is no longer relevant. Closes: bug#268192 (thanks to
    Christian Perrier).
  * Cleaned up debian/copyright:
    + Update copyright and licensing info:
      - Year 2004 included.
      - Clarified distribution with proprietary systems.
      - Include notes about Maildir patch.
    + Replace info contained in changelog with note on "GNU systems".
    + Declare each topic more strictly.
    + Mention "licensing info" together with copyright.
    + Add (historical) copyright info of Stanford University.
  * Silence some tests in debian/rules.
  * Bump standards-version to 3.7.2 (no changes needed).

  * Fix postinst of daemon packages to only append binary when adding to

  * New upstream snapshot.
  * New epoch: Interpret "version number" (for which the license has
    special demands) as only the first segment of the longer string used
    with snapshots and betas (as is done in the documentation).
    This is to allow naming snapshots and other irregular releases
    consistently with regular releases ones.
    It does not excuse my recent stupidity in packaging a developer
    snapshot (although one could argue that it provoked cleaning up for
    next sane excuse).
  * Change debian/rules to correctly recognize VERSION (including
    appending alphabetic character(s)).
  * Add a REVISION field for dealing with snapshots changing the library
    (no excuse for my current stupidity, but may come in handy if
    security cases like 2002a.dev.snap.0212051126 happens again, and
    library changes between snapshots).
  * Correct symlink in libc-client2003debian0 package.
    (Closes: Bug#180699).
  * Use the common debconf area "libc-client" instead of versioned
    string (only question is about a file shared among all versions of
    libc-client anyway).
  * Sync with latest CBS: avoid non-POSIX test syntax.
  * Use sed again to handle VERSION more automatic, and check for
    changes to debian/control (but still avoid editing it
    automatically!).

  * Remove README.debian for libc-client2003-dev, as it speaks only

    files.
  * Refer to /var/mail in debian/mlock.pod, generate mlock.1 from that

    to blow up so I have no email and can't respond to the bug submitters.
    Rest assured I will do so as soon as I can.  Meanwhile this should at
    least solve your immediate problems.  If it doesn't please mail the 
    debian-devel mailing list.  I'll read it through the web interface.
