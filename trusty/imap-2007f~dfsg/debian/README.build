Notes on the package build environment for UW-imap
==================================================

Special filenames
-----------------

*.in:	Master files for replacing - in both filename and content - info
	that is static for each build (like version number).

*._in:	Like *.in but handled later in the build process to include info
	that is static for each package (like package name).
